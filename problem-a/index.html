        <p><a href="https://scandal.fandom.com/wiki/Olivia_Pope">Olivia Pope</a> is the main character in the ABC show <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scandal_(TV_series)">Scandal</a></cite>. She resides in Washington D.C. and is considered to be D.C.'s number one <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixer_(person)">fixer</a> and political campaign manager. Her job is to make her client's problems go away no matter the cost. In the show, she works for a variety of people going through scandals such as senators, businesspeople, and the President of the United States. Additionally, Pope gets into countless scandals herself.</p>
        <p>3 reasons why I admire this character:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>She is a quick problem-solver and she always wants to win</li>
            <li>She is very analytical and not in-touch with her emotions (something I personally relate to)</li>
            <li class="important">She is a badass who can always tell someone off with affirmative wordplay</li>
        </ul>
